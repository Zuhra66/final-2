This project is a Node.js/Express application that integrates a MySQL database to manage and display Pok√©mon-like monsters. The database consists of two tables: elements (storing element types
such as fire, water, and grass) and monsters (containing monster data). The application features three main pages: Home, which displays the top five monsters by score and allows users to view detailed
information via a modal; Monster List, which provides a form to add new monsters and a list of all monsters with options to update their scores; and Quiz, which presents a random monster with
a multiple-choice quiz to guess its element type, graded through a secure Web API. The project also includes structured setup with EJS templates, public directories, and monster images for an engaging
and interactive user experience.
